# Perfect-Guess-Game
This is Perfect Guess Game using python

The Perfect Guess game is a simple number-guessing game played between a player and the computer. The goal of the game is for the player to guess a randomly generated number. The player continues to make guesses until they guess the correct number.

If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program will displays "Lower number please".
If the player's guess is lower than the actual number, the program will displays "Higher number please".
When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
Also save the new game record in the highscore.txt file if the user had broken the previous one.

I have used concepts such as randomisation,file handling and loops in this program.
